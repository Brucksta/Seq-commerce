## Description:
Seq-commerce is an app utlising sequelize to query a database and mimic an eCommerce type vendor that would be found on the internet. This eccomerce app will take for instance a shops products, relate them to eachother for easy navigation on a website/catagorisation of items, and keep the stock levels and prices or items. This backend and Database would be perferct for an online shot, with a tiny bit of customisation to their specific brand/items they sell.
I worked with Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database, and Insomnia to test my GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.

## Installation:
Using node, run npm intall express, sequalise and mysql2  

## Usage:
Simply seed the database and run npm start.
